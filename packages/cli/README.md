# Fairlytics cli

Tools to backup and restore data.

First, you have to configure a `.env` file in this directory.
This file should have theses entries :
- ELASTIC_URL_FROM : URL of the production database. Ex : http://elastic:password@your.domain.com/fairlytics
- ELASTIC_URL_TO : URL of the backup database. Ex : http://elastic:password@localhost:9200/fairlytics
- ELASTIC_CERT_PATH : path to the local certificate generated by the installation script (http_ca.crt)

## Backup

```
yarn backup
```

The backup file `fairlytics.json` will be written to `./backups`. 
It contains all the data from the last 90 days.

## Restore

```
yarn restore
```

Read the file `./backups/fairlytics.json` and push the data to the backup database.
